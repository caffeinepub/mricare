  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-14 by removing continuous/looping animations from the Hero section (animate-float, animate-float-delayed, animate-pulse classes removed) and replacing the auto-scrolling marquee in the Partners section with a static flex-wrap grid. The index.css has had looping keyframe definitions (float, scroll-x) and their utility classes removed. Hover animations and one-time fade-in/counter animations are preserved.",
